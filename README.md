## 🧠 About Us

The **Embodied, Situated & Grounded Intelligence (ESGI)** group explores how intelligence emerges from the interaction between agents and their environments. We believe that truly intelligent systems require grounding in physical reality, rich sensorimotor experiences, and situated understanding of context—principles fundamental to both biological and artificial intelligence.

### Our Vision

> **Intelligence is not just in the agent, but in the dynamic loop between mind, body, and world.**

We aim to bridge the gap between abstract AI models and the messy, unpredictable reality of physical systems. Our research spans theoretical foundations to practical applications, from understanding how humans learn and adapt to building robots and AI systems that can do the same.

## 🔬 Research Areas

- **Learning in Interaction** - Learning in context-dependent environments  
- **Grounded Representations** - Connecting abstract concepts to multiple sensory modalities
- **Human-Robot Interaction** - Seamless collaboration between humans and AI

## 🚀 What We Do

We develop theories, algorithms, and systems that learn from interaction. Whether it's a robot learning to manipulate objects or an AI agent understanding language through sensorimotor grounding, we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible when intelligence is grounded in experience.

**Key Activities:**
- 📚 Publishing cutting-edge research in top-tier venues (e.g., ACL, EMNLP, etc.)
- 🏗️ Building open-source tools and platforms for embodied AI
- 🤝 Collaborating with industry partners and other research groups
- 🎓 Training the next generation of researchers and engineers via the Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs) at the University of Edinburgh
